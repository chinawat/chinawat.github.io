Place: Mount Rainier National Park, Paradise, Washington<br>
Description: After presenting my award-winning paper at <a href="http://pldi2013.ucombinator.org/" target=_blank>PLDI 2013</a> conference in Seattle, I drove to sightsee the highest point in Washington State at <a href="http://www.nps.gov/mora/" target=_blank>Mount Rainier National Park</a>.  Snow was still plenty, so my good friend and I hiked on the invisible snow-buried trail with our pairs of sneakers.  Slipping and sliding, we ended up soaking our footwear, but this picture-perfect day was worth the ride.

Place: Duquesne Incline, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania<br>
Description: This was my fifth time visiting Pittsburgh, but my first time going up the <a href="http://www.duquesneincline.org/" target=_blank>Duquesne Incline</a>.  My first visit to Pittsburgh was when I was a high-school senior, but there is a myth saying that <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/" target=_blank>Carnegie Mellon</a>'s college applicants who go up the Incline before they are admitted will not be admitted.  As a result, this Incline trip had been postponed (and I was accepted).  The river in the photo is the Monongahela River and should not be confused with the other two.  The bridge in the photo is Fort Pitt Bridge, which carries I-376, US-22, and US-30.

Place: Santa Cruz Wharf, Santa Cruz, California<br>
Description: After a day of a conference in San Jose, CA, I drove along CA-17 to see sunset at <a href="http://www.cityofsantacruz.com/index.aspx?page=906" target=_blank>Santa Cruz Wharf</a>.  It was new to see an amusement park along the sandy beach there.  The way back on the winding CA-17 was after dusk, and I do not recommend driving faster than the speed limit, even though most people did that night.

Place: Portage Glacier, Girdwood, Alaska<br>
Description: This is my first time in Alaska.  In addition to visiting <a href="http://www.travelalaska.com/Destinations/Communities/Portage%20Glacier.aspx" target=_blank>Portage Glacier</a>, I went on a 9-hour Northwestern fjord tour in <a href="http://www.nps.gov/kefj/index.htm" target=_blank>Kenai Fjords National Park</a>, attended the Alaskan-style Fourth of July parade in downtown Anchorage, and--as a result of a severely delayed departing flight--appreciating the midnight fireworks.  Needless to say, it was not totally dark by that time.  I had to bring my full set of winter protection there, especially on the cruise tour.  This is also my first time seeing a moose; it was close to where I stayed, in the Anchorage metro area.

Place: Mount Washington, Sargent's Purchase, New Hampshire<br>
Description: This is my second time visiting <a href="http://www.mountwashington.org/" target=_blank>Mount Washington</a>, the "Home of the World's Worst Weather."  The weather was not so bad, as I did not really need a jacket and could wear sandals.  It is sad to hear that the record wind gust of 231 mph was broken in early 2010 (but tracing back to 1996) by a place in Australia.

Place: Mount Major, Alton Bay, New Hampshire<br>
Description: One weekend every year the entire group of new Thai Scholars goes hike Mt. Major. It has got a pretty beautiful view of <a href="http://www.winnipesaukee.com/" target=_blank>Lake Winnipesaukee</a>. We also take lots of photos. This is my fourth time hiking here, this year with the wonderful Thai Scholars 51.

Place: Wallis Sands State Beach, Rye, New Hampshire<br>
Description: After the 11-week orientation program, Thai Scholars 50 had an opportunity to excursion around NH Seacoast near Portsmouth, NH.  One of the stops was <a href="http://www.nhstateparks.org/state-parks/alphabetical-order/wallis-sands-state-beach/" target=_blank>Wallis Sands State Beach</a>.  The seawater was quite cold (about 50F) so I--a TA for the orientation program--was one of the few people getting wet.
