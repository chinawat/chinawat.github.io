<i>Why?</i> United Airlines flight 894 from Anchorage, AK was delayed from an arriving aircraft from Denver due to inclement weather.  A mechanical problem further delayed the flight before departing Anchorage.  Because the crew would exceed the time limit for its rest schedule if the flight were to fly nonstop to Denver, and there was no other crew in Anchorage, United was about to cancel the flight.  A minute later it proposed a solution to fly the aircraft to Seattle for a crew change.  No passengers got off the plane in SEA.  The flight continued on to Denver with the total delay of 5 hours 40 minutes.  Passengers received travel vouchers for compensation.  July 5, 2010.<br>
